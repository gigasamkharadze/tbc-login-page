# Login page for the application
This repository contains a simple login page built using **PyQt5**, 
a powerful Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). 
The login page demonstrates the basic structure of a login form.
For this time, the login page is not connected to any database,
so the user can only enter the username and password
that are hardcoded in the code.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application using the following command:
   ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
   or with the following command:
   ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ``` 

## Usage
Feel free to use this login page as a starting point for your own 
projects. Customize the design, add validation, and integrate 
it with your backend authentication system using **PyQt**.
